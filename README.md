# Disincorporations
Here's where I'll keep track of data, news findings, code, and other stuff for the Disincorporations 3YP.

# Descriptions:
- `ACS Data`is the American Community Survey data pulled from data.census.gov/cedsci/
- `Disincorporation Data` is where I keep (1) a list of disincorporated places generated from the U.S. Census Gazateer files, (2), the list of dropped places from the same source (which may or may not be disincorporations)
- `Gazateers` is where I keep (1) the raw U.S. Census Gazateer data and (2) the R scripts used to clean them
- `Lit` is where I keep PDFs of all literature for the project, including things eventually not cited in the final product
- `Logistics` is where I keep any WashU or other paperwork necessary for the project.
- `MFG Data` is where I keep Municipal Form of Government (MFG) Survey data. This will be kept private and is not to be circulated
- `News Repository` is where I keep PDFs of local news coverage for each dissolution case
- `Ongoing Cases` is where I keep track of any ongoing real-life cases. This is primarily news coverage.
- `Spring 2022` is where my Spring 2022 subprojects are, including the 2022 Causal Inference Poster Project
- `Tigris` is my pilot work incorporating the `Tigris R` package to map these things out.
- `Visualizations` are the code, various figures and visualizations I make throughout the summer.
