# Disincorporations
Here's where I'll keep track of data, news findings, code, and other stuff for the Disincorporations 3YP.

# Descriptions:
- `Disincorporations Repository` is where I keep (1) a list of disincorporated places generated from the U.S. Census Gazateer files, (2), the list of dropped places from the same source (which may or may not be disincorporations), and (3) every piece of news coverage I could find regarding each place on both lists
- `Gazateers` is where I keep (1) the raw U.S. Census Gazateer data and (2) the R scripts used to clean them
- `Lit` is where I keep PDFs of all literature for the project, including things eventually not cited in the final product
- `Logistics` is where I keep any WashU or other paperwork necessary for the project.
- `MFG Data` is where I keep Municipal Form of Government (MFG) Survey data. This will be kept private and is not to be circulated
- `NE Gazateer [TEST]` is a folder where I tested R scripts on smaller samples of gazateer data
- `2022S Causal Inference Project` is, not surprisingly, where I keep the materials for the Causal Inference Poster Project. Due to file size limitations, this does not include the ACS data; contact me if you need it (or just pull it yourself from https://data.census.gov/cedsci/
